## What is Aeronautical?
Aeronautical is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flightâ€“capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of "aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering" and "The profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics)."[1]
